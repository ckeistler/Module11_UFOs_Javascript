# UFOs with JavaScript

## Overview of Project
In this module, we built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. We also created filters to make this table fully dynamic.  It reacts to user input, and then places the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

We customized our webpage using Bootstrap, and equipped our table with several fully functional filters that allow users to interact with the visualizations.

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
